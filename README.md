# expense_tracker
Version 0.2
Expense Tracker is a small python program which can be run from the command line.
The purpose of the program is to record daily expenses whch can then be searched 
or viewed. Later versions will include a calculator to display total costs for tagged
expenses or time periods.
At the moment, the file 'week_expenses.py' is redundant. The program can be run from
the file 'interface.py'.
In order to enter expenses for a day, the week that contains that day must be 
"initiated" from the Enter menu.
Help files and further documentation coming soon.
An example database is included, but can be cleared by simply deleting the contents of
the file 'database'.
